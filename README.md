# UncyclOS
A free and open-source Unix-like operating system inspired by a certain Uncyclopedia article.

## Credits
### Developers
The operating system is developed by JJPMaster and forked from napalmtorch's PurpleMoon OS, whose source code can be found [here](https://github.com/napalmtorch/PurpleMoon/).

### Special thanks
A few people who I think helped make this project possible include Cassie from Uncyclopedia (who by merely *disclosing* that she uses GNU/Linux convinced me to create my own OS), and David Gerard, who helped create the Uncyclopedia article that inspired this project, [Command Line](https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/Command_Line).

## One other note
It's written in C# using the Cosmos library.
